> Marvin, more fully known as Marvin the *Paranoid Android*, is an incredibly brilliant but overwhelmingly depressed robot manufactured by the **Sirius Cybernetics Corporation** and unwilling servant to the crew of the *Heart of Gold*.

## No seriously, what is Marvin?

Marvin is a **Slack Bot layout** for *Flask* to develop *Slack* event handlers and deploy on *AWS Lambda* + *API Gateway*.

## Quickstart

Install [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/es_es/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and configure the *marvin* profile

```sh
$ pip install awscli --upgrade --user
$ aws configure --profile marvin
```

Then create a zappa configuration file `zappa_settings.json` and upload your `config.json` file to your s3 bucket using the same url as the `remote_env` field from your `zappa_settings.json`.

Here we go!

```sh
$ make lambda
