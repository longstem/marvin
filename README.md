> Marvin, more fully known as Marvin the *Paranoid Android*, is an incredibly brilliant but overwhelmingly depressed robot manufactured by the **Sirius Cybernetics Corporation** and unwilling servant to the crew of the *Heart of Gold*.

## No seriously, what is Marvin?

Marvin is a **Slack Bot layout** for *Flask* and *Asyncio* to develop [*Slack* Event](https://api.slack.com/events) handlers and deploy on *AWS Lambda* + *API Gateway*.


## Create a Slack bot user

See the [Slack's documentation](https://api.slack.com/bot-users#getting-started) for further guidance on creating your bot (**step 1**).

Within the *Basic Information* about your application, copy the **Signing Secret** necessary to [verify requests from Slack](https://api.slack.com/docs/verifying-requests-from-slack>).

![Signing Secret](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5514990/53696736-cfde0e00-3dfc-11e9-9aeb-23d184f8c600.png)

Now go to the *OAuth & Permissions* section and copy the **Bot User OAuth Access Token** to configure the Bot's credentials.

![OAuth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5514990/53776565-fc8f4400-3f28-11e9-9d7f-f4f24809c5e0.png)


## Configure your Application

Fill in your `.env` file with your `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` and `SLACK_API_TOKEN` keys obtained in the previous **step 1**

```sh
$ cp .env.example .env
```

üê£ Build the local environment:

```sh
$ make up
```

To avoid cyclic calls between subscriptions and API calls, set the Slack variables that identify your Bot:

```sh
$ make botinfo
```

```
{
    "id": "AGOAULRCZ",
    "name": "marvin",
    "profile": {
        "bot_id": CGK8R9V7S",
    },
    "is_bot": true
}
```

Copy the `id` value for `SLACK_BOT_USER_ID` and the `bot_id` value for `SLACK_BOT_ID` from your `.env` file and reload the Docker container.

```sh
$ make reload
```

üöÄ Run your local server:

```sh
$ make run
```

Finally, you need a **Public URL** to subscribe to *Slack* events, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) to create a tunnel to development server and get your public url:


```sh
$ make ngrok
```

![ngrok](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5514990/53827525-ec6d7800-3fad-11e9-92c1-a912b2241e1f.png)

As you can see in the image, *ngrok* has assigned to the development server a subdomain `dd15a495`, so the Public URL is `https://dd15a495.ngrok.io/api/v1/slack/events`.

## Configure your Slack Bot

Continue with the [Slacks's documentation](https://api.slack.com/bot-users#setup-events-api) to setting up the Events API (**step 2**) and enter the URL to receive the subscriptions:

![Enable Events](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5514990/53777794-1df22f00-3f2d-11e9-85bd-03dcb9c9c848.png)

Select the [Slack Events](https://api.slack.com/events) you want to subscribe to, these events are required for the code examples in your project's `app/handlers` directory.

![Suscribe to bot Event](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5514990/53778614-f0f34b80-3f2f-11e9-96de-3cb2d1a8e0c3.png)

Finally, install your bot to a workspace (**step 3**).


## AWS Lambda Deployment

Install [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/es_es/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and configure the *marvin* profile

```sh
$ pip install awscli --upgrade --user
$ aws configure --profile marvin
```

Then create a zappa configuration file `zappa_settings.json` and upload your `config.json` file to your s3 bucket using the same url as the `remote_env` field from your `zappa_settings.json`.

Build your Œª docker container:

```sh
$ make lambda
```

Here we go!

```sh
$ make zappa cmd=deploy
```

```sh
$ make help
```
